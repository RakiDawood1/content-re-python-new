[13.24s - 15.80s] A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.
[16.88s - 18.10s] I had just driven home,
[18.12s - 20.66s] it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,
[20.68s - 22.98s] I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,
[23.00s - 27.78s] and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --
[27.80s - 30.90s] and don't bother asking
if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
[30.92s - 33.38s] minus 40 is where the two scales meet --
[33.40s - 34.66s] it was very cold.
[34.68s - 37.90s] And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,
[37.92s - 40.18s] I found I didn't have my keys.
[40.20s - 42.30s] In fact, I could see them
through the window,
[42.32s - 45.42s] lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.
[45.44s - 48.58s] So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,
[48.60s - 50.18s] and they were locked tight.
[50.20s - 53.34s] I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,
[53.37s - 56.70s] but at midnight, it could take a while
for a locksmith to show up,
[56.72s - 58.88s] and it was cold.
[60.42s - 63.14s] I couldn't go back to my friend
Jeff's house for the night
[63.16s - 65.83s] because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,
[65.85s - 68.09s] and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.
[68.40s - 70.90s] So, desperate and freezing cold,
[70.92s - 74.54s] I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,
[74.56s - 76.54s] cleared out the shards of glass,
[76.56s - 77.90s] I crawled through,
[77.92s - 81.34s] I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,
[81.36s - 83.98s] figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,
[84.00s - 86.78s] I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.
[86.80s - 88.28s] This was going to be expensive,
[88.30s - 91.86s] but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
[91.88s - 96.04s] so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.
[96.92s - 99.10s] Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training
[99.12s - 103.22s] and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.
[103.24s - 106.78s] It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,
[106.80s - 109.06s] it modulates adrenaline levels
[109.08s - 110.56s] and it clouds your thinking.
[111.08s - 113.06s] So the next morning,
[113.08s - 115.54s] when I woke up on too little sleep,
[115.56s - 118.30s] worrying about the hole in the window,
[118.32s - 121.10s] and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,
[121.12s - 122.82s] and the freezing temperatures,
[122.84s - 125.30s] and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
[125.32s - 128.86s] and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,
[128.88s - 130.26s] my thinking was cloudy,
[130.28s - 133.70s] but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.
[133.72s - 135.22s] (Laughter)
[135.24s - 138.50s] And it wasn't until I got
to the airport check-in counter,
[138.52s - 140.78s] that I realized I didn't have my passport.
[140.80s - 142.82s] (Laughter)
[142.84s - 146.30s] So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,
[146.32s - 148.78s] got my passport,
raced back to the airport,
[148.80s - 150.62s] I made it just in time,
[150.64s - 152.88s] but they had given away
my seat to someone else,
[152.90s - 155.88s] so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,
[155.90s - 159.12s] in a seat that wouldn't recline,
on an eight-hour flight.
[159.88s - 163.34s] Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.
[163.36s - 164.50s] (Laughter)
[164.52s - 167.18s] And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,
[167.20s - 169.14s] systems that I can put into place,
[169.16s - 171.62s] that will prevent bad things
from happening?
[171.64s - 173.54s] Or at least if bad things happen,
[173.56s - 178.56s] will minimize the likelihood
of it being a total catastrophe.
[179.36s - 180.94s] So I started thinking about that,
[180.96s - 183.82s] but my thoughts didn't crystallize
until about a month later.
[183.84s - 187.54s] I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
[187.56s - 190.94s] and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,
[190.96s - 193.38s] and, you know, forgotten my passport,
[193.40s - 194.62s] and Danny shared with me
[194.64s - 199.14s] that he'd been practicing
something called prospective hindsight.
[199.16s - 200.90s] (Laughter)
[200.92s - 204.06s] It's something that he had gotten
from the psychologist Gary Klein,
[204.09s - 206.14s] who had written about it
a few years before,
[206.16s - 208.26s] also called the pre-mortem.
[208.28s - 210.23s] Now, you all know what the postmortem is.
[210.26s - 211.74s] Whenever there's a disaster,
[211.76s - 216.06s] a team of experts come in and they try
to figure out what went wrong, right?
[216.08s - 218.50s] Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
[218.52s - 222.42s] you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,
[222.44s - 225.02s] and then you try to figure out
what you can do
[225.04s - 228.54s] to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.
[228.56s - 231.50s] So what I want to talk to you about today
[231.52s - 235.06s] are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.
[235.08s - 237.98s] Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.
[238.00s - 239.94s] I'll start with the obvious ones.
[239.96s - 245.04s] Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.
[245.68s - 249.54s] Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,
[249.56s - 252.10s] but there's a lot of science
to back this up,
[252.12s - 255.42s] based on the way our spatial memory works.
[255.44s - 258.30s] There's a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,
[258.32s - 261.26s] that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,
[261.28s - 265.06s] to keep track of the locations
of important things --
[265.08s - 267.50s] where the well is,
where fish can be found,
[267.52s - 270.02s] that stand of fruit trees,
[270.04s - 272.66s] where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
[272.68s - 274.58s] The hippocampus is the part of the brain
[274.61s - 278.10s] that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.
[278.12s - 281.82s] It's the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
[281.84s - 284.70s] And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment
[284.72s - 287.50s] where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
[287.52s - 289.34s] and they could still find their nuts.
[289.36s - 292.18s] They weren't using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,
[292.20s - 297.22s] this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.
[297.24s - 300.98s] But it's really good for things
that don't move around much,
[301.00s - 303.46s] not so good for things that move around.
[303.48s - 307.78s] So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.
[307.80s - 310.30s] So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --
[310.32s - 313.18s] a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.
[313.20s - 315.30s] For your passport, a particular drawer.
[315.32s - 318.10s] For your reading glasses,
a particular table.
[318.12s - 321.58s] If you designate a spot
and you're scrupulous about it,
[321.60s - 324.42s] your things will always be there
when you look for them.
[324.44s - 325.66s] What about travel?
[325.68s - 328.06s] Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,
[328.08s - 330.38s] your driver's license, your passport,
[330.40s - 332.66s] mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
[332.68s - 337.06s] If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.
[337.08s - 339.70s] Now these are some rather obvious things.
[339.72s - 343.26s] Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.
[343.28s - 346.50s] Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.
[346.52s - 349.06s] So part of the practice of the pre-mortem
[349.08s - 353.34s] is to recognize that under stress
you're not going to be at your best,
[353.36s - 355.66s] and you should put systems in place.
[355.68s - 358.62s] And there's perhaps
no more stressful a situation
[358.64s - 362.06s] than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to make.
[362.08s - 365.38s] And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,
[365.40s - 367.78s] where we have to make
a very important decision
[367.80s - 371.10s] about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,
[371.12s - 372.78s] to help them with a decision.
[372.80s - 374.42s] And so I want to talk about that.
[374.44s - 377.46s] And I'm going to talk about
a very particular medical condition.
[377.48s - 381.02s] But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
of medical decision-making,
[381.04s - 385.06s] and indeed for financial decision-making,
and social decision-making --
[385.08s - 387.34s] any kind of decision you have to make
[387.36s - 391.38s] that would benefit from a rational
assessment of the facts.
[391.40s - 394.54s] So suppose you go to your doctor
and the doctor says,
[394.56s - 398.68s] "I just got your lab work back,
your cholesterol's a little high."
[399.24s - 402.26s] Now, you all know that high cholesterol
[402.28s - 406.42s] is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,
[406.44s - 407.86s] heart attack, stroke.
[407.88s - 409.10s] And so you're thinking
[409.12s - 411.22s] having high cholesterol
isn't the best thing,
[411.24s - 414.26s] and so the doctor says,
"You know, I'd like to give you a drug
[414.28s - 417.06s] that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin."
[417.08s - 418.98s] And you've probably heard of statins,
[419.00s - 421.81s] you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs
[421.83s - 423.01s] in the world today,
[423.03s - 425.11s] you probably even know
people who take them.
[425.13s - 427.52s] And so you're thinking,
"Yeah! Give me the statin."
[427.54s - 429.98s] But there's a question
you should ask at this point,
[430.00s - 431.86s] a statistic you should ask for
[431.88s - 434.34s] that most doctors
don't like talking about,
[434.36s - 437.52s] and pharmaceutical companies
like talking about even less.
[438.80s - 441.18s] It's for the number needed to treat.
[441.20s - 443.18s] Now, what is this, the NNT?
[443.20s - 446.26s] It's the number of people
that need to take a drug
[446.28s - 449.14s] or undergo a surgery
or any medical procedure
[449.16s - 451.54s] before one person is helped.
[451.56s - 454.42s] And you're thinking,
what kind of crazy statistic is that?
[454.44s - 455.66s] The number should be one.
[455.68s - 457.74s] My doctor wouldn't prescribe
something to me
[457.76s - 459.05s] if it's not going to help.
[459.07s - 461.55s] But actually, medical practice
doesn't work that way.
[461.58s - 463.11s] And it's not the doctor's fault,
[463.13s - 466.05s] if it's anybody's fault,
it's the fault of scientists like me.
[466.08s - 468.94s] We haven't figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.
[468.97s - 471.38s] But GlaxoSmithKline estimates
[471.40s - 476.38s] that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
[476.40s - 480.22s] So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,
[480.24s - 482.38s] what do you suppose it is?
[482.40s - 485.22s] How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?
[485.24s - 486.44s] 300.
[487.07s - 488.46s] This is according to research
[488.48s - 491.98s] by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
[492.00s - 494.78s] independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
[494.80s - 497.20s] I ran through the numbers myself.
[497.92s - 500.30s] 300 people have to
take the drug for a year
[500.32s - 504.30s] before one heart attack, stroke
or other adverse event is prevented.
[504.32s - 505.70s] Now you're probably thinking,
[505.73s - 508.54s] "Well, OK, one in 300 chance
of lowering my cholesterol.
[508.56s - 510.78s] Why not, doc? Give me
the prescription anyway."
[510.80s - 513.66s] But you should ask at this point
for another statistic,
[513.68s - 516.26s] and that is, "Tell me
about the side effects." Right?
[516.28s - 517.94s] So for this particular drug,
[517.96s - 521.62s] the side effects occur
in five percent of the patients.
[521.64s - 523.31s] And they include terrible things --
[523.33s - 527.77s] debilitating muscle and joint pain,
gastrointestinal distress --
[527.80s - 529.66s] but now you're thinking, "Five percent,
[529.68s - 531.70s] not very likely
it's going to happen to me,
[531.72s - 532.96s] I'll still take the drug."
[532.98s - 534.18s] But wait a minute.
[534.20s - 536.54s] Remember under stress
you're not thinking clearly.
[536.56s - 539.72s] So think about how you're going
to work through this ahead of time,
[539.75s - 542.95s] so you don't have to manufacture
the chain of reasoning on the spot.
[542.97s - 545.46s] 300 people take the drug, right?
One person's helped,
[545.49s - 547.90s] five percent of those 300
have side effects,
[547.92s - 549.40s] that's 15 people.
[549.80s - 553.70s] You're 15 times more likely
to be harmed by the drug
[553.72s - 556.54s] than you are to be helped by the drug.
[556.56s - 559.46s] Now, I'm not saying whether you
should take the statin or not.
[559.49s - 562.63s] I'm just saying you should have
this conversation with your doctor.
[562.66s - 563.98s] Medical ethics requires it,
[564.00s - 566.30s] it's part of the principle
of informed consent.
[566.32s - 569.54s] You have the right to have access
to this kind of information
[569.56s - 573.46s] to begin the conversation about whether
you want to take the risks or not.
[573.48s - 574.70s] Now you might be thinking
[574.72s - 577.42s] I've pulled this number
out of the air for shock value,
[577.44s - 580.70s] but in fact it's rather typical,
this number needed to treat.
[580.72s - 585.34s] For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,
[585.36s - 587.58s] removal of the prostate for cancer,
[587.60s - 590.18s] the number needed to treat is 49.
[590.20s - 594.38s] That's right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who's helped.
[594.40s - 599.06s] And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.
[599.08s - 601.94s] They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,
[601.96s - 604.74s] urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,
[604.76s - 606.22s] fecal incontinence.
[606.24s - 609.74s] And if you're lucky, and you're one
of the 50 percent who has these,
[609.76s - 611.80s] they'll only last for a year or two.
[612.88s - 616.50s] So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time
[616.52s - 619.06s] to the questions
that you might be able to ask
[619.08s - 621.46s] that will push the conversation forward.
[621.48s - 624.58s] You don't want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.
[624.60s - 627.50s] And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.
[627.52s - 629.30s] Because you have a choice oftentimes,
[629.32s - 631.62s] do you I want a shorter life
that's pain-free,
[631.64s - 635.42s] or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?
[635.44s - 637.86s] These are things to talk about
and think about now,
[637.88s - 639.70s] with your family and your loved ones.
[639.72s - 642.22s] You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,
[642.24s - 645.30s] but at least you're practiced
with this kind of thinking.
[645.32s - 649.94s] Remember, our brain under stress
releases cortisol,
[649.96s - 652.30s] and one of the things
that happens at that moment
[652.32s - 654.26s] is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
[654.28s - 656.18s] There's an evolutionary reason for this.
[656.21s - 659.62s] Face-to-face with a predator,
you don't need your digestive system,
[659.64s - 662.10s] or your libido, or your immune system,
[662.12s - 665.78s] because if you're body is expending
metabolism on those things
[665.80s - 667.46s] and you don't react quickly,
[667.48s - 671.46s] you might become the lion's lunch,
and then none of those things matter.
[671.48s - 672.90s] Unfortunately,
[672.92s - 676.54s] one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress
[676.56s - 678.54s] is rational, logical thinking,
[678.56s - 681.98s] as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.
[682.00s - 685.18s] So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead
[685.20s - 687.46s] to these kinds of situations.
[687.48s - 693.66s] I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
[693.68s - 696.54s] We all are going to fail now and then.
[696.56s - 700.18s] The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,
[700.20s - 704.10s] to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,
[704.12s - 707.64s] or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.
[708.28s - 710.94s] Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,
[710.96s - 712.70s] when I got back from my trip,
[712.72s - 716.58s] I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,
[716.60s - 720.14s] with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.
[720.16s - 721.38s] And I have to admit,
[721.40s - 724.82s] I still have piles of mail
that haven't been sorted,
[724.84s - 727.42s] and piles of emails
that I haven't gone through.
[727.44s - 729.22s] So I'm not completely organized,
[729.24s - 732.38s] but I see organization
as a gradual process,
[732.40s - 733.62s] and I'm getting there.
[733.64s - 734.86s] Thank you very much.
[734.88s - 739.27s] (Applause)
